<h2>Business Problem Overview and Solution Approach</h2>
<p>Buying and selling used phones and tablets used to be something that happened on a handful of online marketplace sites. But the used and refurbished device market has grown considerably over the past decade, and a new IDC (International Data Corporation) forecast predicts that the used phone market would be worth $52.7bn by 2023 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% from 2018 to 2023. This growth can be attributed to an uptick in demand for used phones and tablets that offer considerable savings compared with new models.</p>
<p>Refurbished and used devices continue to provide cost-effective alternatives to both consumers and businesses that are looking to save money when purchasing one. There are plenty of other benefits associated with the used device market. Used and refurbished devices can be sold with warranties and can also be insured with proof of purchase. Third-party vendors/platforms, such as Verizon, Amazon, etc., provide attractive offers to customers for refurbished devices. Maximizing the longevity of devices through second-hand trade also reduces their environmental impact and helps in recycling and reducing waste. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak may further boost this segment as consumers cut back on discretionary spending and buy phones and tablets only for immediate needs.</p>
